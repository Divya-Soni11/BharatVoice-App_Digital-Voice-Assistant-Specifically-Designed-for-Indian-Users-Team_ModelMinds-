# üîç Debugging: No Audio Issue

## üì± I've Added Comprehensive Logging

The app now has **detailed logging** at every step to identify why there's no audio.

---

## üß™ Testing Steps

### Step 1: Clear Previous Logs

```powershell
$env:Path += ";C:\Users\ckaur\Downloads\platform-tools-latest-windows\platform-tools"
adb logcat -c
```

### Step 2: Start Monitoring Logs

```powershell
adb logcat | Select-String "AccessibilityAssistant|TextToSpeech"
```

Leave this running!

### Step 3: Test on Your Phone

1. **Open your app**
2. **Go to Apps tab**
3. **Enable Gallery with "Always On"**
4. **Press Home button**
5. **Open Gallery app**
6. **Stay in Gallery**

### Step 4: Check PowerShell Output

You should see logs like:

```
AccessibilityAssistant: =================================================
AccessibilityAssistant: üîä AUTO-READ SCREEN STARTED
AccessibilityAssistant: Package: com.android.gallery3d

## üîç Diagnostic Scenarios

### Scenario A: No Logs at All

**Means:** App switch detection isn't working

**Check:**

1. Is accessibility service enabled?
    - Settings ‚Üí Accessibility ‚Üí Your app ‚Üí Should be ON
2. Try disabling and re-enabling the service

### Scenario B: Logs Show "TTS initialized: false"

**Means:** TextToSpeech engine isn't initializing

**Fix:**

1. Check if Google TTS is installed:
    - Settings ‚Üí System ‚Üí Languages & input ‚Üí Text-to-speech output
2. Make sure a TTS engine is selected
3. Try changing TTS engine
4. Restart your phone

### Scenario C: Logs Show "Audio focus request result: -1"

**Means:** Audio focus is being denied

**This is OK now** - The new code speaks anyway!

### Scenario D: Logs Show "TTS speak ERROR"

**Means:** TTS can't speak for some reason

**Fix:**

1. Test TTS manually:
    - Settings ‚Üí Accessibility ‚Üí Text-to-Speech ‚Üí Play sample
2. If that doesn't work, TTS engine is broken
3. Install "Google Text-to-Speech" from Play Store

### Scenario E: Everything Logs Success But No Audio

**Means:** Volume or audio routing issue

**Check:**

1. **Notification volume** - This is the key!
    - Press volume buttons
    - Make sure NOTIFICATION volume is up (not just media)
2. **Do Not Disturb** - Make sure it's OFF
3. **Silent mode** - Make sure phone isn't on silent
4. **Bluetooth** - If connected to headphones, try disconnecting

## üéØ Quick Audio Checklist

Test these in order:

- [ ] **Volume Check**
    - Press volume up
    - Swipe down notification shade
    - Check all volume sliders (Media, Call, Ring, Alarm, Notification)
    - **Notification volume must be > 0!**

- [ ] **TTS Engine Check**
    - Settings ‚Üí System ‚Üí Languages & input ‚Üí Text-to-speech output
    - Tap settings (gear icon) next to engine
    - Play sample - **Does it speak?**

## üîß Manual TTS Test

Let's test if TTS works at all:

### On Your Phone:

1. Go to **Settings**
2. **System** ‚Üí **Languages & input**
3. **Text-to-speech output**
4. Tap the **gear icon** next to your TTS engine
5. Tap **"Play"** or **"Listen to an example"**
6. **Do you hear audio?**

**If NO:**

- Your TTS engine is broken
- Install "Google Text-to-Speech" from Play Store
- Select it as default engine
- Try again

**If YES:**

- TTS works, issue is with our app
- Share the logcat output with me

---

## üìã What to Share

If still no audio, share:

1. **Logcat output** (from Step 2 above)
2. **Phone brand/model**
3. **Android version**
4. **Which TTS engine you're using**
5. **Does manual TTS test (above) work?**

## üö® Most Common Issues

### 1. Notification Volume = 0

**90% of "no audio" issues!**

**Fix:** Press volume up, make sure NOTIFICATION slider is up!

### 2. Do Not Disturb Enabled

**Blocks notification sounds**

**Fix:** Swipe down twice, tap DND to disable

### 3. TTS Engine Not Installed

**Phone doesn't have TTS**
