## 🔋 Battery Impact

### Battery Usage

**Low Impact Design:**

- Uses ~2-5% battery per hour
- Optimized wake word detection
- Lightweight background service

### Tips to Minimize Battery Drain

1. **Only enable when needed** - Toggle off when not using
2. **Use on WiFi** when possible
3. **Close other battery-draining apps**

## 📋 Commands You Can Use

Once activated with "Hey Assistant", try:

### Screen Reading

- "What's on this screen?"
- "Read the screen"
- "Describe what you see"

### Navigation

- "Scroll down"
- "Scroll up"
- "Go back"

### Actions

- "Click [button name]"
- "Tap [element]"
- "Open [app name]"

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Wake word not working?

**Check 1: Is the toggle ON?**

- Go to Assistant tab
- Make sure "Wake Word Detection" is enabled
- You should see a notification

**Check 2: Microphone permission**

- Settings → Apps → startup_hackathon2.0 → Permissions
- Microphone should be "Allowed"

**Check 3: Battery optimization**

- Settings → Battery → Battery Optimization
- Find your app → "Don't optimize"

**Check 4: Background restrictions**

- Settings → Apps → startup_hackathon2.0
- Make sure "Background activity" is allowed

### App doesn't open when I say "Hey Assistant"

**Try these:**

1. Speak clearly and at normal volume
2. Reduce background noise
3. Check notification - does it say "Wake word detected"?
4. Restart the service (toggle OFF then ON)

### High battery drain?

**Solutions:**

1. Toggle off when not needed
2. Check for other apps using microphone
3. Reduce wake word usage frequency

### Notification is annoying?

Unfortunately, Android requires a notification for foreground services. But:

- It's minimized (low priority)
- Provides useful status updates
- You can minimize it in notification settings
